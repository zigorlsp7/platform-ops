 * The OpenTelemetry bootstrap.

 * by patching modules as they load, so anything required ahead of it goes
 * untraced. In practice that means `import './observability/tracing';` on the
 * first line of `main.ts`, above every other import.
 *
 * Auto-instrumentation rather than a hand-picked list: it covers http, express,
 * nest, pg and kafkajs without each service having to remember to add the one
 * it just started using. `fs` is off because it produces a span per file read
 * and drowns everything else.
