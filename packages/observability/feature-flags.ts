/**
 * Feature flags.
 *
 * The point of a flag is to separate *deploying* code from *enabling* it. That
 * matters most for the thing the estate has not done yet: a risky migration.
 * Shipping the new path behind a flag that defaults to off means the deploy and
 * the switch are two decisions, made at different times, and the second one is
 * reversible without a rebuild.
 *
 * Deliberately not a service. LaunchDarkly and friends solve per-user targeting
 * and gradual rollout, neither of which this estate needs; what it needs is a
 * declared list, a default, and the ability to see what is on in a running
 * process. Anything more is a dependency and a network call in the request
 * path.
 *
 * Flags are read once at startup. A flag that changes under a running process
 * gives you two behaviours in one request and a bug nobody can reproduce; the
 * way to change one is to restart with a different value, which is also the
 * thing you can roll back.

 * heard of, or every flag while the server is unreachable, falls back to the
 * value `registerFlags` already resolved. Losing the flag service therefore
 * degrades to the declared defaults rather than to an outage.
 *
 * Resolves once the first flag set has been fetched, so a caller can await it
 * at startup and avoid serving one request from defaults and the next from the
 * server. It resolves rather than rejects on failure, for the same reason.
 *
 * The SDK is imported through a non-literal specifier so the compiler does not
 * try to resolve it: this file is vendored into every repository, and most of
 * them declare flags without talking to a flag server. Only the ones that call
 * this function need the dependency.
