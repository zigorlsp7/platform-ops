/**
 * Feature flags.
 *
 * The point of a flag is to separate *deploying* code from *enabling* it. That
 * matters most for the thing the estate has not done yet: a risky migration.
 * Shipping the new path behind a flag that defaults to off means the deploy and
 * the switch are two decisions, made at different times, and the second one is
 * reversible without a rebuild.
 *
 * Deliberately not a service. LaunchDarkly and friends solve per-user targeting
 * and gradual rollout, neither of which this estate needs; what it needs is a
 * declared list, a default, and the ability to see what is on in a running
 * process. Anything more is a dependency and a network call in the request
 * path.
 *
 * Flags are read once at startup. A flag that changes under a running process
 * gives you two behaviours in one request and a bug nobody can reproduce; the
 * way to change one is to restart with a different value, which is also the
 * thing you can roll back.
